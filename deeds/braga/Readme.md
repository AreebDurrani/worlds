#Braga Island#

The Braga island is mainly meant to be the default world for the Deeds ruleset. It's main purpose is to show off what's possible with the Worldforge system while at the same time provide fun and engaging gameplay.
The island contains a mixture of combat and crafting gameplay.

##Goals##

The main goal on the island is to subdue the Shadow Altars that are dispersed around the land. The altars produce both monsters and terrain modifications which makes it impossible to traverse and farm the land. In order to subdue the altars the players must first destroy all monsters that have been spawned by them, and then offer various goods to the altar. The altar will consume the goods, thus making it content.
This process must be ongoing, i.e. the players need to keep feeding the altars. Thus there's game play in place which makes crafting and resource allocation necessary.
The altars will require increasingly more expensive resources the farther away from the starting position they are. This also encourages crafting since it's expected that more elaborate resources can only be obtained through more and more complex crafting.
