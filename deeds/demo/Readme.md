#Demo World#

This is a demo world intended to show off basic features of the system. It's meant to be used as a reference for world authors, as well as a testbed for new features. It is continously updated with new features as they are added.
It's primarily meant to be experienced as an "admin" character. Each demonstration should have a signpost explaining what's being shown.
